Gets data from World Bank API, visualizes CO2 emissions to the user. Takes as input country names in English. Has its own JSON API at `/api/<country>/<'kt'/'percapita'>`, for example https://akseli.eu.pythonanywhere.com/api/China/kt. Made with Python, Flask and pandas.

I'd still like to enhance the frontend with animations, AJAX queries and a list from which to pick countries. It would also be interesting to pull out other kinds of graphs from the data.
